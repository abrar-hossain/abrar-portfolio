                    Hi All,  My name is abrar. I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh. My dream is to become a good programmer. <br />I love to code. Coding is my passion. I always try to solve programming problems.<br />
                    Besides, coding watch movies, playing football, cricket. In my spare time, I try to read books. Travelling is my most favorite hobby.<br />
